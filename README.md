# NeoPixelPicController

Project that uses a PIC device (PIC18F4550) and NeoPixel led strip (WS2812B).

I haven't saw any PIC project that handle Neopixel strip, so I decided to try.

The project uses Bluetooth comunication to set the patterns. The master device is an Andriod phone, I made an application that let the user select the patter, the color of the strip and the delay time for the pattern. Also, in some patterns you can set the brightness.

Feel free to use the code.
